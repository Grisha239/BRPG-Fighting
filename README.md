# BRPG-Fighting

This code can help you calculate the probability of winning against monster in Board Role-Play Game.
Every time you do something, you roll a dice pool. Each even dice is success, odd - failure.
You add up all results. If every dice is even, it is Critical Success, if odd - Critical Failure.
My program run fighting against Monster 100k times, and count the approximate probability of winning.
